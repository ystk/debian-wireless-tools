/etc/iftab
----------

If you have installed the ifrename package and have created an /etc/iftab file,
then ifrename will be called at boot time before the interfaces are brought up.
Please note that swapping the names of interfaces (ie, by renaming eth0 to eth1
and eth1 to eth0) may not work. To be on the safe side, use new names for the
interfaces.
